      <description>Create from scratch The objective of this project was to demonstrate that it is possible to create a sustainable factory using plastic waste, human energy and solar thermal energy.
With the help of Recua we reproduced the solar injection machines, invented by volks.eco and Plastok.
After building the machines, Liquen eyewear co-developed and manufactored this sunglasses from scratch.
We take care of every step between the idea and the final product.</description>

      <description>Quick shape The aim of this project was to create a practical product that could be personalized and quickly. To save time, we have developed a new process for making injection molds using 3D printing.
We can design and create moulds in a short time.</description>

      <description>We teach it After more than a year of experience in plastic recycling with solar thermal energy, we are available to teach you and demonstrate the effectiveness of our process.
Want to learn how solar plastic injection works. take a look at our Workshop Agenda.
We can explain how to create recycled plastic products using solar energy.</description>

      <description>We create our machines Our manual solar-concentrating machines are the key to the ecological production of recycled plastic objects.
Based on the shared know-how, we have built, tested, used and characterized the plastic injection process using solar energy.
After more than a year of using the solar thermal process, we were able to list the optimization points for a process guaranteeing the production of machines and products on a larger scale.</description>

      <description>Solar plastic recycling is the most environmentally friendly way to recycle plastic using solar thermal energy to melt the plastic.
Introduction Every year in the world the plastic waste represents 245 Megatons, only 16% is recycled, 22% is incinerated with energy recovery and 62% is landfilled and incinerated without energy recovery.
Plastic recycling is the reprocessing of plastic waste into new and useful products. When performed correctly, this can reduce dependence on landfill, conserve resources and protect the environment from plastic pollution.</description>

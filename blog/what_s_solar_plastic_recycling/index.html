    <p><strong>Solar plastic recycling is the most environmentally friendly way to recycle plastic using solar thermal energy to melt the plastic.</strong></p>

<h2 id="introduction" class="anchor-link"><a href="#introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></a></h2>
<p>Every year in the world the plastic waste represents 245 Megatons, only 16% is recycled, 22% is incinerated with energy recovery and 62% is landfilled and incinerated without energy recovery.</p>
<p>Plastic recycling is the reprocessing of plastic waste into new and useful products. When performed correctly, this can reduce dependence on landfill, conserve resources and protect the environment from plastic pollution.</p>

<h1 id="plastic-types" class="anchor-link"><a href="#plastic-types"><strong>Plastic types</strong></a></h1>
<p>Plastic waste consists of various polymer types, its exact composition will vary, but the estimated global average is shown below :</p>

<h1 id="standard-plastic-recycling-process" class="anchor-link"><a href="#standard-plastic-recycling-process"><strong>Standard Plastic Recycling Process</strong></a></h1>
<p><strong>1. Collecting</strong></p>
<p>This first step in the recycling process is the collection of post-consumer materials. This can be done by the local or by private parties.</p>
<p><strong>2. Categorizing</strong></p>
<p>The different types of plastic should be separated and sorted by properties and color. This step is important to increase efficiency and avoid contamination of the final products.</p>
<p><strong>3. Washing [Electric]</strong></p>
<p>This step  is crucial for plastic recycling, thus eliminating impurities that can hinder the operation. Product labels and adhesives, as well as dirt and food residue are the main impurities.</p>
<p><strong>4. Shredding [Electric]</strong></p>
<p>The plastic is fed into shredders, which break it down into pieces. These can be used for other applications without further processing, such as an additive in asphalt or simply sold as raw material.</p>
<p><strong>5. Separation of plastics [Electric]</strong></p>
<p>There are several different types of plastic (see above), which must be separated from each other by recyclers. Additionally, plastics can be sorted by other properties such as color. This is done by machines at the recycling plant.</p>
<p><strong>6. Injection + Extruding [Electric]</strong></p>
<p>This final step in the plastic recycling process is where the shredded plastic particles are turned into a usable product. The plastic is melted and injected into molds for the final shape or extruded to obtain profiles.</p>
<p><strong>As can be seen, in a standard plastic recycling process, some steps require electrical machinery, making you dependent on the grid. In addition, heating plastic for injection is energy-intensive.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Solar plastic recycling process is the most ecological way to recycle plastic. This Sun Made process does not require electricity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Collecting</strong></p>
<p>This first step in the recycling process is the collection of post-consumer materials. This can be done by the local or by private parties. We suggest using household plastic or industrial disposables which are relatively cleaner.</p>
<p><strong>2. Categorizing</strong></p>
<p>The different types of plastic should be separated and sorted by properties and color. This step is important to increase efficiency and avoid contamination of the final products.</p>
<p><strong>3. Washing [Manual]</strong></p>
<p>This step  is crucial for plastic recycling, thus eliminating impurities that can hinder the operation. Product labels and adhesives, as well as dirt and food residue are the main impurities.</p>

<p><strong>5. Separation of plastics [Manual]</strong></p>
<p>There are several different types of plastic (see above), which must be separated from each other by recyclers. Additionally, plastics can be sorted by other properties such as color. If plastic types and colors are separated before shredding this step is easier.</p>
<p><strong>6. Melting the plastic  [Solar + Manual]</strong></p>
<p>To melt the shredded plastic, it is put in metal cartridges and then heated using a solar concentrator that can reach 300°C. The temperature of the plastic is to be monitored with an electronic probe.</p>
<p><strong>7. Injection [Manual]</strong>
The molten plastic is transferred from the cartridge into the mold by a manual press, giving the recycled plastic a new shape.</p>

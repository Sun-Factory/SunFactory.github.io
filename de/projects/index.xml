      <description>Create from scatch The objective of this project was to demonstrate that it is possible to create a sustainable factory using plastic waste, human energy and solar thermal energy.
With the help of Recua we reproduced the solar injection machines, invented by volks.eco and Plastok.
After building the machines, Liquen eyewear co-developed and manufactored this sunglasses from scratch.
We take care of every step between the idea and the final product.</description>

      <description>Quick shape The aim of this project was to create a practical product that could be personalized and quickly. To save time, we have developed a new process for making injection molds using 3D printing.
We can design and create moulds in a short time.</description>

      <description>We teach it After more than a year of experience in plastic recycling with solar thermal energy, we are available to teach you and demonstrate the effectiveness of our process.
Want to learn how solar plastic injection works. take a look at our Workshop Agenda.
We can explain how to create recycled plastic products using solar energy.</description>

      <description>We create our machines Our manual solar-concentrating machines are the key to the ecological production of recycled plastic objects.
Based on the shared know-how, we have built, tested, used and characterized the plastic injection process using solar energy.
After more than a year of using the solar thermal process, we were able to list the optimization points for a process guaranteeing the production of machines and products on a larger scale.</description>
